# In this example we are going to add simple numbers

2+2;  #it give you 4 but on your console

#To run this follow.

#lets make a simple Variable

# x; #Now x is the variable

x = 2; # we Assign x is 2;

#let print what is the value of x

print "The value of x is " + str(x);   # we type str function because x was the interger and we can not type interger with string 

print "Another value of x is " + `x`;   # the New Shotcut to print x using ecapse character.

x = x+1  #Incrementing

print "Incrementing x value is " + str(x); # now the value of is 3;
print "Another Incrementing x value " + `x`;

y = 2;

print 'Print Modules of x ' +str(x%y);  #printing Modules of x ? 1 because value of x is 3/2 reminder will be 1


#an other method to print modules

#let make it in variable

z = x % y;   # Here we assign value of z which will be equal to reminder of x;
 
# print 'sdfd'
 
print 'The Value of x is ' + str(z);
 
#  #OR
 
print "The value of X is " + `z`;

#Also Please Note Proper indentaion is important in Python to run code.

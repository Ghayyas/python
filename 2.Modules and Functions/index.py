#There is having some modules and functions in Python.

# let say we want to 5 power 4

x = 5 ** 4

print 'The power of 5 to 4 is ' + str(x); 

# an other method to print power is 

x = pow(5,4);

print "The Power of 5 is " + `x`;

# What if we want some more math functions Like Floor? to do this we need to import math library

import math;

x = math.floor(5.904343579);

print "The New Value of X is " + str(x);


# Square Root 

x = 2;

z = math.sqrt(x);

print "The value of z and Square root of 2 is " + `z`

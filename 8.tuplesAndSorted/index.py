# In this section we are to learn Tuples and Sort,

# So what is Sort?

# Let say you have four numbers 22,34,21,33 
# how do you make them in accesding order?
# If we sort them how they Print?
# They will print somthing like this 21,22,33,34
# Thats all called sorting.

#let make it in python.

sortedItem = [1,3,5,2,4,8,6,7,9];
 
sortedItem.sort();  # to make sorting we need to call sort function

print sortedItem;  # And BAM its sorted...

#lets sort String..

stringSort = 'Ghayyas';

sortedString = sorted(stringSort);

print sortedString; # And BAM it prints them in AlphaBetical order.


#Tuples

tuples = 23,34,43,44;   

print tuples;  # so they are in round brackets called tuples

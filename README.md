#Python programing Language

Simple Working with Python Language.

To run on your terimal type:
`python index.py` where index.py is any python file name.
 
 Also Please Note Proper Indentation is Very Important in python. Your may not run beacuse of Indentation.
 
 for example: <br />
 `z = y + x` <br />
   `print z`
  it will gives you error to indent
 to fix this you need to properly indent that.
 
 Example:
 
 `z = y + x` <br />
 `print z`
 
 Now it works fine.
